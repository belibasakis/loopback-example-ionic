## Getting started
Before starting, makes sure you've followed [Getting Started with LoopBack](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/Getting+started+with+LoopBack) to install Node and LoopBack.
In adittion, you will need a basic understanding of:
 - [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/)
 - Ionic [CSS](http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/) and [Javascript](http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/) components  

```
git clone https://github.com/belibasakis/loopback-example-ionic
cd loopback-example-ionic
npm install 
slc run
```
Open a new terminal
```
cd loopback-example-ionic/client
npm install
ionic serve
```
Open [localhost:8100](http://localhost:8100/) in your browser to view the app or get the (PhoneGap Developer App)[http://app.phonegap.com/] to run the app on your phone.
Don't forget to change the api url in `client/www/lib/lb-services.js` to the IP of your local machine.
```
 var urlBase = "http://192.168.0.102:3000/api";
```

## ToDo
- Implement Passport.Js for FacebookAuth
- Optimize performence (less requests to server)
- Add feature like edit, delete...

## Ionic
All Ionic files are in the `client/www` folder. Documentation how this app works are inside the `*.js` files

## Loopback
By default, data in the memory connector are transient.  When an application using the memory connector exits, all model instances are lost.  To maintain data across application restarts, I specified a JSON file in which to store the data.
`server/datasources.json``
```
{
  "db": {
    "name": "db",
    "connector": "memory",
    "file": "memoryDb.json"
  }
}
```
I created some sample content and user so you can start right of:

 Username | Password 
 -------- | -------- 
 James    | james    
 Bob      | bob      
 Mary     | mary     

### Usefull commands
- `lb-ng server/server.js client/www/lib/lb-services.js`to generate Loopback Service for AngularJS based on your project
- `lb-ng-doc client/www/lib/lb-services.js` show documentation for generated file
